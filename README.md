# Overview

This program attempts to apply CUDA concepts to a 2x2x2 cube compose of subcube that have 100x100x100 elements. The kernel adds all the numbers together to create an output

This software was written to enhance my understanding of how CUDA works and how you can apply it to code.

# Development Environment

The project was written in Visual Studio since we are working with C++ and a lot of the heavier lifting is done here. We attempted to use CUDA as a coding platform here as well
